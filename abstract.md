Among many of the natural disasters, earthquakes are one of the most damaging and devastating. Determining earthquake source depth still exists as one of the problematic areas within earthquake source seismology work. This project aims to explore the construction of earthquake depth prediction models for earthquakes that occurred around Puerto Rico. Data was sourced from the United States Geological Survey Earthquake Catalog, and included observations from January 1st, 2009 through January 1st, 2019. Input predictor variables included latitude, longitude, normalized magnitude values, log energy released, and the distance from the closest city that the earthquake ruptured. This project used a regression approach; models included Random Forest, and gradient boosting algorithms LightGBM and XGboost. Results indicated that better modeling approach, additional data, and understanding of the complex relationships between variables is necessary to construct a well developed predictive model for earthquake depth.
